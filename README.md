## Database Schema: 
- User Login Table: Represents users with a unique user_id.
- Product Table: Represents products with a unique prod_id.
- Cart Table: Represents the shopping cart, linking user_id to prod_id with a quantity.
- Order Table: Represents orders made by users with a unique order_id, and links to user_id.

## E-R Diagram:
- The user_login table has a one-to-many relationship with the cart table via user_id.
- The product table has a one-to-many relationship with the cart table via prod_id.
- The user_login table has a one-to-many relationship with the order table via user_id.

- Created an intuitive user interface that enhances the shopping experience, making navigation and interaction effortless.

**6. Efficient Database Interaction with MySQL:**
- Connected the application to a MySQL database using a custom Python module (mysqlConn.py), enabling efficient data handling.
- Wrote optimized SQL queries to perform operations on the user, product, cart, and order tables, ensuring fast and reliable data processing.

**7. Seamless API Integration for Frontend-Backend Communication:**
- Built and integrated custom APIs to handle data requests and responses between the frontend and backend, enabling real-time data interaction and smooth user experiences.
